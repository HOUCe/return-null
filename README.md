# `return null;`
### React Europe 2017 Talk


Plan:

- Start by mentioning Ryan Florence's 2016 React Rally talk
- Explain how I want to show some examples of neat, practical usecases for React components that don't render anything.

- Why would we want to do this?
- 2 reasons: lifecycle hooks and local component state


- Example 1: event listeners

Learning to play the piano, decided to make  a rhythm game to teach me to read sheet music.

class KeyboardEventListener extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
}




<After time="17:30">
  {() => this.setState({ isEvening: true })}
</After>
