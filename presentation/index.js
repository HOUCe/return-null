            So, today I'd like to talk about components.
            <br /><br />
            React components are typically used to render views.
            <br /><br />
            Because this is how they're most often used, it's natural to think of them as template renderers.
            You write some markup, pass it some data via props, and in return you get stuff rendered to the screen.
            <br /><br />
            Something I've come to realize, though, is that this 'component' pattern is useful for more than just visual UI.
            When you use React components, you get a lot of things "for free", things like lifecycle hooks, internal state...
            <br /><br />
            To illustrate this idea, today I'll be sharing some components that don't render anything to the DOM.

            Takes two props: Language, defaults to "english", and children,
            which is the message to speak.
            <br /><br />
            An 'utterance' is the thing that gets spoken. You pass it to the
            Web Speech API when it's ready.
            <br /><br />
            The Web Speech API has a few quirks, and one of them is that voices
            are loaded async when you attempt to use them. This means that the
            very first time we try to say something, we won't have any voices.
            'forceUpdate' is a native React method, and it triggers a new update
            cycle, which causes the 'render' method to fire again.
            <br /><br />
            Like any good component, we'll ensure that we don't leave any side
            effects when our component unmounts.
            <br /><br />

            So, that's kinda cool, but what have we gained?
            <br /><br />
            The big benefit so far is that DictationBox doesn't have to be
            at all concerned with the Speaking business. We've encapsulated that
            concern.
            <br /><br />
            You might say that we could have encapsulated it just as well using
            helper functions, but that's not entirely true; the Web Speech API,
            like so many other APIs, has some quirks, and so we'd need to add
            several lifecycle methods to DictationBox, deal with the async
            loading of voices, etc. This way, the entirety of the Speak behaviour
            can be encapsulated, and reused anywhere.
            <br /><br />
            While building this, though, I realized that I'd be delivering
            this talk in France, and it really should be bilingual. As with any
            work project, the requirements have changed, and now we get to test
            how adaptable this solution is.
